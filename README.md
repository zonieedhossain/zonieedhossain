On a personal level, I am highly motivated to apply my skills and
expertise to interesting and rewarding projects for myself As growth
potential, I prefer to develop my skills mostly in Go. I love to work
and also love to learn new things. Learning new things is like a fun.
I can spend lot's of time for leaning and implementing and exploring
new things.
